This is a simple bot that I've created for GCI 2018. It gets the information about particular JBoss Outreach repo in a user-friendly way. 

To run it on your own machine:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install all dependencies using npm
3. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and paste there your own, private Telegram Bot API token
4. Should work :)
